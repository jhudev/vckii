Title: Simplified data management for verification, version control,
        and error detection

Description: Simple error detection and version control for the importing, exporting, and
    transfering of data using CRC32 checksum. A hash file is generated for each dataset
    containing the summary hashes for all columns and rows along with col/row names. Each file is created 
    before exporting a dataset and compared to hashes after importing to ensure consistency 
    in the datasets between working sessions of each user. In addition, each file 
    contains hashes organized by row and column which can be used for easy debugging of 
    potential errors.
